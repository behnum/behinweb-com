During the course of working on MedixCo, a not-so-large project intended to be available in two languages—Persian (as the primary one) and English—I realized how challenging it is to design a bilingual user interface. Along with having a simple UI, it was intended to be fast and responsive.

Despite the fact that almost all of the back-end development was a cinch, thanks to the Laravel Framework, there was still one decision I had to make. It was about the way the owner could administer the content—whether to redirect them to separate admin areas (per language) or to present everything through a single area. The challenge was content direction, specifically dealing with RTL/LTR. I didn't relish the idea that, while most things were going to be identical and sort of duplicated on both sides, the admin had to switch between different panels. Therefore, I opted for the latter option and combined the two.

Now, I'd say it turned out pretty well. Most features are fully configurable, everything is easily within reach, and the admin won't need to navigate back and forth between different pages to target the desired version of the website.
